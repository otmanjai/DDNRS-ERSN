DDNRST-ERSN
===========

An Open Nuclear Reactor Simulator and Reactor Core Analysis Tool based on the Version5 of the reactor physics codes DRAGON-5 &amp; DONJON-5 developed at École Polytechnique de Montréal.
DRAGON & DONJON Reactor Simulator (DDNRST-ERSN) is an open nuclear reactor simulator and reactor core analysis tool that solves reactor equations for one, two or three dimensional geometries.

DDNRST-ERSN is also a great learning tool for nuclear reactor theory classes.The main objectives is to make all nuclear engineering students have access on nuclear reactor simulator tool for them to use, learn, and modify for their own purposes. It is open and completely free, so everyone has access to the source codes.
The code, including the graphical user interface is developed and maintained by JAI Otman (Nuclear Engineering PhD) and Prof. EL HAJJAJI Otman from University Abdelmalek Essaadi Tetouan Morocco.
